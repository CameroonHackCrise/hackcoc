Hi there,

You are receiving this email because you've previously supported the
Hack Code of Conduct.

I've just made some big changes to the design, but more importantly
I've added a way for you to edit your entry of support. This was a much
requested feature, especially for those of you who had custom versions of
the Code of Conduct for their hackathons.

Follow the link below to request to edit your entry.

<%= new_edit_url %>

That's all of it really.

Cheers,

Cristiano Betta
